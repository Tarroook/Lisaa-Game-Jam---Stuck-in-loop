# Overtime

Overtime is a top down shooter where you play as a man that is stuck in an infinite loop of fighting monsters and getting killed in the confines of his workplace.
You will have to loop through 8 rooms and try to survive for as long as you can. There is no escape... or is there ?

Unknown powers are in effect in this workplace. Every time you clear a room, modifiers will be given to you.

## Uprgades :
Upgrades will help you survive longer but are only in effect when you are in the room they are applied to.
When picking up an upgrade you are then given the choice of which room do you want this upgrade to be applied to.

## Downgrades :
Downgrades work the same as upgrades, but they aren't here to help you.
For every upgrade you pick up, you will also need to pick a downgrade.

Place your modifiers strategically if you want to survive long enough. Maybe one day you'll find a way to break the loop...
